It's been a long journey here, to Flatiron school. I'm actually quite surprised i've made it this far. 
A girl who never really belived in herself. Someone who never thought she could do it.

**SHE HAD THE HEART BUT DID SHE HAVE THE BRAINS?!**

The journey began in Nigeria. Ibadan, Nigeria. 
I don't remember much about my life then just tad bits of good times and the few tramatic moments.
I do however remember the day we left. My mother won the visa lottery and we were headed to the United States!

**MY MOTHER, MY HERO**

My brother and I were wearing matching outfits, the whole family was at our apartment.
Everyone was crying. I was wondering why everyone was so sad. 
The air was rich of emotions.
I didn't understand why the moment was so heavy. 
I didn't understand the journey that was about to commence.

Growing up as an immigrant was hard. Kids were brutual.
Kids from the same background, still brutual it doesn't matter.
They didn't know better. 
Here's someone different, someone they don't understand so they bullied.

> Why does she dress like that? Why does she sound like that?
> What is she wearing? What's up with her hair?!

Elementary was hard but I wasn't ready for middle school.
I spent most of my childhood shelled and a bit broken.

Kids throwing things at me. Pointing, laughing, and shoving were an everyday thing for me.
Have you ever had an egg thrown at your head in front of the entire student body?
It seemed the hate for me grew with age.
It was then I began to internalize the pain. It was then I began the negative self-talk.
All I was surrounded by was "stupid", "ugly", "dumb" (being my name is Dami). 
I didn't know it then but I was internalize the outer hate and turning it in inner hate.

I blanked out. 
Skipped school a bunch and to hell with a gpa.
College pushed me a bit but still wasn't into it.

>Be super smart but feel dumb
>Be super pretty but feel ugly
>Do the bare minimum and you'll be ok

This was how I lived my life for years to come but I was young and free so it didn't matter.
She's pretty let her be wild. She's fun it's just in her nature.

Until reality set in and the real world kicked in.

**Who was I? Underneath all the pain who was I?**

**What did I want to do? Do I really know myself?**

Take out all the things people have said......
Take away the names, the fear, the pain.....
Take away the heartbreaks......
Take away the cluelessness....
What did I want? 

>NO-FREAKING-IDEA.
>I'M BLANK!!!!

Finally a moment to myself and I didn't even know me.
The insecurities were louder than the love.
I was afraid to do anything. I felt powerless. I felt hopeless.

Here I was looking for something to help me feel for the first time in life
but I felt nothing. 
Finally one day I snapped out of it.

**I began to research about myself, delved into everything I knew I loved.**

I wanted to finally mean something to myself and give childhood me a voice.
So it was time.....
I devoted months of decisively being focused on myself and building my esteem and confidence.
I felt something in me happening.
I had been telling myself I would take up coding for about a year. 
I tried other things but this was filling a void, this was keeping my mind controlled.
I was seeing different.

Didn't know how or when but I was going to do it.  
As a kid **I knew I loved computers, I knew I loved tech.**
I knew the industry would be easy for me.
I finally told myself I was going to be disciplined, focused and hard-working for once.
I spent months researching and doing some online work.

>For the first time I felt like giving something my ALL!!

I researched schools but I needed a job first!
So I applied and landed the job I wanted.

>I must be headed on the right track :)

Job secured and now I just needed to apply for schools. 
I needed to find the perfect school for me. 
The wrong one could potentially hurt my process.
The wrong school would throw me off course. 

Then I found Flatiron and the process has been so smooth since.
Applied, got accepted! Scholarship, in the bag!
I did have enough sense to know I couldn't get this without a little extra help.
So I got an in-person tutor, I had to be prepared. 

**I found something I loved and needed to give it all I could.**

I needed to give it everything in me. This was what I decided I wanted to do and love.
This is what I decided was going to change my life.
I've been in love since I started and want to keep the passion going.

>There are so many opportunties for me here.
>So many ways I could change lives through learning this.
>I want to change lives, for the better.

It has been a hard journey so far and can be frustrating but i'm getting it.
I've got the help I need and people who support me.

### I have something to prove to myself.
I am determined to finish. 
I am determined to show myself what I mean to myself.
